# AffineCarpetProject
## Introduction
This project was created to collect data for my Summer 2020 REU with the University of Conneticut. During this REU, my research group studied the [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) known as the [Affine Sierpinski Carpet](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SelfAffineVariantsOfTheSierpinskiCarpet/), which is a generalized version of the more well-known [Sierpinski Carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_carpet). The aim of this code is to calculate the resistance of many different types of affine pre-carpets (since creating the actual infinite shape would be impossible) and plot this data in useful ways.
